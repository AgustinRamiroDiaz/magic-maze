# Magic Maze - Game Overview

## Game Concept

Magic Maze is a real-time cooperative board game where players work together to help four fantasy characters (Barbarian, Elf, Mage, and Dwarf) navigate through a shopping mall to steal equipment and escape.

## Core Gameplay Loop

1. Players start with a limited tile layout representing the mall
2. Characters must reach specific objectives (weapon shop, armor shop, etc.)
3. Players collaboratively move all characters using their assigned actions
4. New tiles are revealed as characters explore
5. Time pressure is constant - a sand timer runs continuously
6. Players must complete objectives and reach the exit before time runs out

## Unique Mechanics

### Split Control System
- Each player does NOT control a single character
- Instead, each player controls ONE type of action for ALL characters
- Example: Player 1 moves all characters North, Player 2 moves all South, etc.

### Silent Cooperation
- No verbal communication is allowed during gameplay (except specific moments)
- Players must coordinate through observation and intuition
- "Do Something" pawn can be used to signal other players

### Real-Time Pressure
- Continuous time limit (sand timer)
- Hourglass tokens on the board allow timer resets when reached
- Creates tension and forces quick decision-making

## Win/Lose Conditions

### Victory Conditions
1. All four characters reach their designated item locations
2. All characters return to the yellow exit tile
3. All within the time limit

### Failure Conditions
1. Time runs out before objectives are completed
2. Players cannot make legal moves (deadlock situation)

## Player Count
- Designed for 1-8 players
- Online multiplayer implementation should support 1-8 concurrent players

## Difficulty Scaling
- Multiple scenario cards with increasing difficulty
- More objectives and constraints in harder scenarios
- Can be implemented as different game modes/levels

## Game Duration
- Typical game: 3-15 minutes per scenario
- Quick rounds make it ideal for online play
